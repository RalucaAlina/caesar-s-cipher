# caesar-s-cipher
It is an encryption technique in which each character in plain text is replaced by a character some fixed number of positions down to it.
For example, if key is 3 then we have to replace character by another character that is 3 position down to it. Like A will be replaced by D, C will be replaced by F and so on.
